## Overview and Origin
**Grammarly Inc** was founded by Max Lytvyn, Alex Shevchenko, and Dmytro Lider in 2009 (Grammarly, 2024, We’ve climbed a long way). The idea of Grammarly was inspired by a previous venture that Max Lytvyn and Alex Shevchanko had developed in their college days called MyDropBox, which was built to keep plagiarism out of writing. This led them to a ask a question: “Why do people choose to plagiarize in the first place? Could it be that they were finding it difficult to communicate what they meant in their own voice?” They started Grammarly to help solve this problem (McEvoy, 2021, Grammarly Founders).

## Funding
The business was bootstrapped since its founding in 2009 up until 2017 (Geron, 2017, Grammarly). It has gone through two venture rounds in 2017 and 2019, followed by a private equity round in 2021 raising a total of $400 million at a valuation of $13 billion. <br />

The initial venture round of funding was led by General Catalyst and with participation from Breyer Capital, IVP, SignalFire and Spark Capital. The second venture round of funding was again led by General Catalyst and with participation from IVP and Sozo Ventures. The private equity round of funding was led by Baullie Gifford and BlackRock Inc (Crunchbase Inc, 2024, Grammarly Financials).<br />

<br />

The main ones being PowerWritingAid, Hemmingway App, WhiteSmoke, Readable, WordTune, Ginger, Sapling, PaperRater, Reverso, Slick Write, LanguageTool, Writer and SentenceCheckup (Holcombe,2023, 13 Alternatives to Grammarly). Grammarly stands out from its competitors based on the quality and quantity of services that they provide. Midson-Short (2022), listed some of the fields where Grammarly outclasses its competitors:

* Conventions – Writers had to rely on style guides in the past, but Grammarly provides it within their service.

## Technology
Grammarly’s products are powered by an advanced system that combines rules, patterns, and artificial intelligence techniques like machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing to improve your writing (Grammarly, 2023, How to use AI). Alikaniotis (2023), describes how Grammarly broke the problem down into two pieces during development of their technology: Extracting the main points from the text and detecting where the reader is likely to focus their attention on the text. Throughout the development process Grammarly had to be creative and thoughtful to achieve and deliver successful results to writers at a very low latency that could scale to 30 million daily active users across a variety of devices and contexts. The steps they took to develop their technology are listed below:
* Defining the task to model – Grammarly with their in-house analytical linguists built a framework where the first step was to identify the main points and the action points in a message and the second step was to give each point an importance score.
* Developing the model – Grammarly took the following steps to build a successful model:
    * Reviewing the research – Grammarly were able to learn from traditional approaches used to extract the main points in a writing. They used this research and improved it by using modern techniques.
    * Developing features – They then worked with their in-house analytical linguists to build a robust set of language-based features.
    * Optimizing the model – used optimization strategies to reduce the scope of the problem and bring down the model’s inference times.<br />

The NPL stack includes: Python, Clojure, Java, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, OpenNLP, Emory NLP, spaCy, OpenNMT, AllenNLP, SageMaker, Jupyter notebooks and the Machine Learning stack includes: Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, SageMaker, TensorFlow, Marian, Vowpal Wabbit (Grammarly, 2024, Technology).

## Landscape
Grammarly is in the field of writing enhancement where it leverages its Artificial Intelligence communication assistant to help writers find the right words or help them get their point across. Over the past 10 years the field has seen major advancements due to advancements in Artificial intelligence and automation, creating personalized content, UX design, content reuse & collaborative content creation, processing power, cloud technologies, and internet availability around the world. These trends are expected to continue over the next decade or more as advancements in these areas is only accelerating (Elmira, 2023, The Future of Technical Writing).

Grammarly uses number of teams and daily active users as the core metric to measure the success of the company. Currently 70,000+ professional and enterprise teams are using Grammarly. There are 30,000,000+ daily active users (Grammarly, 2024, About).<br />
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/images/core_metrics.png" alt="drawing" style="width:750px;"/><br />
</div>
Americas dominated the writing enhancement software market in 2022, with a market share of 42.98%. Grammarly is the major player in the writing enhancement market, with a market share of 27.75% (Industry Outlook 2023 Reports, 2024, Region Overview). Their overall market share has continued to increase since their inception in 2009.<br />

## Recommendations
The company has a lot of prospects that it can pursue to grow and gain market share: 
* Currently Grammarly only supports the English language. This restricts its use to English speaking countries or people. A bar chart below shows the current users divided by region (Solangi, 2024, Worldwide Usage): <br />
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/images/worldwide_usage.png" alt="drawing" style="width:500px;"/><br />
</div>
They can increase the number of daily active users, one of its core metrics to measure success, if they were to increase the number of languages the service is provided in. Some of their competitors are already providing their service in multiple languages. For Grammarly to provide their service in more languages they would need to employ linguists and annotators that hold expertise in that language. In terms of technology no major modifications would be required to incorporate this change.
* Currently Grammarly has a limit of 1,000 AI prompts/month for their premium service. I believe they should not have a limit as most of their competitors do not have one with their paid service. This would need Grammarly to increase the size and number of servers to process the data. 
* Grammarly can make errors and wrong suggestions from time to time (PaperBlazer, 2024, Disadvantages of Grammarly). It is important that they continue working with their in-house linguists, annotators, and other teams to continue improving the product.
* Grammarly product is fast but still requires time to process the changes (PaperBlazer, 2024, Disadvantages of Grammarly). Larger data centers equipped with better hardware can help improve the quality of service.
